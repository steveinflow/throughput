PR Throughput Simulator

Interactive visualization showing how PRs flow through a software team.
Producers write code, PRs queue up for review, and reviewers process them.

Adjust producer productivity and reviewer speed to see how bottlenecks form.
When producers outpace reviewers, the blocked queue grows and throughput
turns red. When reviewers can keep up, throughput is green.
